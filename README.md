# Simple Pendulum

A simple damped pendulum in Python. Tested with the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Usage

To run, use:
```
$ python pendulum.py
```

An animation can be created by changing the `save` variable to `True`. Since the matplotlib animation seemed to be locked to a single thread, saving animation seems to take a while. Otherwise, the animation itself is very fast.
